## Description

Typescript version of Cosmic Python Book https://github.com/cosmicpython/code
The purpose is to refresh my TypeScript and DDD knowledge. This implementation does not follow the Python version line by line. I will also add some technical aspects related to microservices and distributed systems that the book and Python version do not cover.
